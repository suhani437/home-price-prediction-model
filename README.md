1. Introduction
HomePricer is a data-driven web application developed as a mini project by a group of four enthusiastic BCA students from section 'f1'. The project's core objective is to predict house prices using linear regression, a foundational algorithm in machine learning. With the rise of data-centric decision-making in real estate, this project aims to provide users with a tool that can offer estimated home values based on historical and real-time data.

2. Project Objectives
To apply machine learning techniques for real-world data prediction.

To gain hands-on experience with supervised learning using Python.

To build a responsive and user-friendly web interface.

To explore the influence of property features, location, and market trends on pricing.

3. Technology Stack
Backend & Machine Learning:
Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning Library: Scikit-learn

Model Used: Linear Regression

Development Tools: VS Code, Replit

Frontend Development:
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Framework: React.js

Features: Responsive design, real-time input validation, clean and intuitive UI

4. Dataset and Data Sources
The accuracy and reliability of a machine learning model are highly dependent on the quality and richness of the dataset. For HomePricer, the dataset was curated by aggregating data from multiple trustworthy real estate databases. Key aspects of the dataset include:

Historical Home Sales: Past selling prices provide a benchmark for future predictions.

Property Features: Includes area (sq. ft.), number of bedrooms, bathrooms, age of the property, and amenities.

Geographical Information: Neighborhood profiles, proximity to schools, transport, shopping areas, etc.

Market Indicators: Real estate trends, economic conditions, and inflation indexes.

The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure normalization for optimal model performance.

5. Model Implementation
We implemented a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn, an efficient machine learning library in Python. The model was trained using a supervised learning approach where:

Input Features: Property size, number of rooms, location index, etc.

Target Variable: House sale price

Steps in Model Development:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.

Model Training: Fitting the linear regression model to the dataset.

Evaluation Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² score.

Deployment: Model integrated into the web app for real-time predictions.

6. Frontend User Interface
The frontend was designed using React.js for dynamic component rendering. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to ensure responsiveness and cross-device compatibility.

Key Features:
Interactive form inputs for user data entry

Instant price prediction on submission

Visual feedback and form validation

Clean, modern layout for ease of use

7. Results and Insights
The linear regression model demonstrated a reliable ability to predict house prices with reasonable accuracy on the test set. Key insights observed include:

Larger properties in prime locations consistently yielded higher prices.

Neighborhood characteristics significantly impacted valuation.

Older homes showed variable pricing, depending on renovations and locality.

8. Challenges Faced
Data Cleaning: Managing missing and inconsistent data values.

Feature Selection: Choosing the most impactful features for prediction.

UI Integration: Seamlessly connecting the frontend with the backend model.

9. Conclusion and Future Scope
HomePricer effectively showcases how machine learning can be applied to real estate price prediction. The combination of Python, Scikit-learn, and React enabled the team to build a functional, educational, and practical tool.

Future Improvements:
Integrate real-time data APIs for live updates.

Introduce additional algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, XGBoost) for comparison.

Implement user authentication and data saving features.

Deploy the app on cloud platforms for broader accessibility.
